# 1.0.0 (2023-06-02)


### Bug Fixes

* Fixing the path for the release ([f28e23e](https://github.com/klcodanr/mvn-semantic-release-issue-demo/commit/f28e23eea33f9b38b9f6676b0eb3e4048b3de2c3))
* hopefully fixing the commit issue ([6d2aa3f](https://github.com/klcodanr/mvn-semantic-release-issue-demo/commit/6d2aa3f52aee6411e29ed0e7141ef8cdb88b4c93))
* I think the problem was the settings ([3b00219](https://github.com/klcodanr/mvn-semantic-release-issue-demo/commit/3b0021933ef996cf446d72f87b830327bd99e295))
